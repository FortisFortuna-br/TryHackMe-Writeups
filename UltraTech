1. Service Discovery
We start by identifying open ports and running services using rustscan:

Port 21 (FTP): vsftpd 3.0.3

Port 22 (SSH): OpenSSH 7.6p1 (Ubuntu)

Port 8081 (HTTP): Node.js (Express) - This is our primary target (API)

Port 31331 (HTTP): Apache 2.4.29 - Hosting the frontend

2. Reconnaissance
Visiting http://10.48.151.8:31331 shows a standard website. I ran a dirsearch on this, which led to /robots.txt. Inside, an interesting entry points to /map.txt. Checking that reveals a login page at /partners.html. This is where things start getting juicy.

3. API & Command Injection
While poking around the login page, you'll notice the frontend talks to an API on port 8081. Specifically, a "ping" functionality:
http://10.48.151.8:8081/ping?host=10.48.151.8

I tested for Command Injection by appending a subshell:
http://10.48.151.8:8081/ping?host=$(ls)
Boom! It worked. It returned a file list, including a database named utech.db.sqlite.

4. Cracking the Credentials
I read the database content using the injection, found a bcrypt hash for user r00t, and saved it to hash.txt. Then I fired up John the Ripper:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
After a short wait, John cracked it. Now I had the SSH password.

5. Privilege Escalation (The Docker Way)
I logged in via SSH: ssh r00t@10.48.151.8. Running id showed that the user is part of the docker group.
This is a golden ticket. I used a classic one-liner to mount the host filesystem into a container:
docker run -v /:/mnt -it alpine chroot /mnt sh

By doing this, I'm "breaking out" to view the host's drive with root privileges. I navigated to /root and grabbed the root.txt flag. Mission accomplished!
